GitHub Basics: Key Concepts and Definitions
================================================

This file serves as a reference for key concepts covered in the GitHub collaboration workshop.

1. Repository (Repo)
--------------------
A repository is like a project folder that contains all of your projectâ€™s files and the revision history for each file.

2. Clone
--------
Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of a GitHub repository on your computer so you can work on it.

Command Example:
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

3. Fork
-------
Forking is creating a personal copy of someone else's repository to your own GitHub account so you can freely experiment with changes.

4. Branch
---------
A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It allows you to work on different features without affecting the main branch.

Command Example:
    git checkout -b new-feature

5. Commit
---------
A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It represents a change made to the codebase.

Command Example:
    git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

6. Push
-------
Pushing means sending your committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.

Command Example:
    git push origin branch-name

7. Pull Request (PR)
---------------------
A pull request lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in your forked repository.

8. Merge
--------
Merging takes the changes from one branch (e.g., a feature branch) and applies them into another (e.g., main).
